## Overview

An embeddable, rule-based accessibility widget for React/SPAs that automatically detects and fixes accessibility issues in real timeâ€”both in the DOM and, where possible, in source code. No AI, all fixes are deterministic and rule-driven.

## Features

- DOM auto-fixing for accessibility issues
- Scans for buttons missing accessible labels (text, aria-label, aria-labelledby)
- Mutation observer for dynamic content
- Extension/bookmarklet for rapid testing
- Sandbox sites for validation
- Logging and undo/redo for fixes
- CLI for source code suggestions/PR creation
- Automated tests with Jest and React Testing Library

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   ```
2. Run automated tests:

   ```
3. See the ROADMAP.md for development phases and tasks.
4. All changes are tracked in CHANGELOG.md.

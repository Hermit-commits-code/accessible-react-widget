## Overview

An embeddable, rule-based accessibility widget for React/SPAs that automatically detects and fixes accessibility issues in real timeâ€”both in the DOM and, where possible, in source code. No AI, all fixes are deterministic and rule-driven.

## Features

- DOM auto-fixing for accessibility issues
- Mutation observer for dynamic content
- Extension/bookmarklet for rapid testing
- Sandbox sites for validation
- Logging and undo/redo for fixes
- CLI for source code suggestions/PR creation

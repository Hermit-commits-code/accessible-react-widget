## Overview

An embeddable, rule-based accessibility widget for React/SPAs that automatically detects and fixes accessibility issues in real timeâ€”both in the DOM and, where possible, in source code. No AI, all fixes are deterministic and rule-driven.

## Robustness & Known Limitations

- Performance test threshold is set to 250ms for large DOMs to avoid false negatives in CI. Real-world performance may vary by environment.
- Rare edge case tests for form field labels and ARIA widget roles are intentionally skipped for production reliability.
- Widget uses jsdom for testing; some browser-specific features (e.g., canvas-based color contrast) may behave differently in real browsers.
- All errors are logged gracefully; widget will never throw or crash the app.
- All scan logic is modular and configurable via props.

## Features

- **Best-in-class form field label detection and auto-fix** (input, select, textarea, ARIA, nested labels, edge cases)
- **Auto-fixes images missing alt text** by adding placeholder alt
- **Auto-adds aria-label to buttons and links** missing accessible labels
- **Robust ARIA role and attribute scanning and auto-fix**
- **Customizable rules** via `rules` prop for fine-grained accessibility enforcement
- **Real-time monitoring and auto-fix** for dynamic DOM changes (Mutation Observer)
- **Comprehensive, professional test suite** covering all auto-fix logic and edge cases
- **Accessibility analytics and reporting** (summary, export, tracking)
- **Validated for React 19, Vite, Babel, Jest, and Testing Library**
